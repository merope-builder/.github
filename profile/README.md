""**m**ak**e** **r**esearch **o**ut**p**uts, **e**asier"

A toolkit of template repositories which automate data access, analysis, result visualisation and compilation of a research paper document.
Depending on the processing time required to run the analyses, these are suitable for execution using github's continuous integration facility (Github actions).

## Technologies

- Scripting language: Python (though the principle equally suited for R or other scripting languages)
- Document source format: Markdown, YAML metadata (for authors, affiliations etc)
- Document compilation: pandoc
- Bibliographic references data format: bibtex
- Dependency management and build automation: make
- Continuous integration: Github actions

## Etymology
*[Merope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merope_(Pleiad))* is a figure in Greek myth, one of the [Pleiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades) and the wife of [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus). You can draw your own conclusions about the relevance of Sisyphus to the construction of research outputs, but often when we're fully committed to a difficult and lengthy task, somebody closeby will be able to offer a simpler way.
